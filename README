THIS PROGRAM IS OBSOLETE. It does not work with Skype clients from about
2011 onwards.

A simple Skype log parser, released under the GPLv3 or, at your
option, any later version.

The current version only works on very old Skype logs, and provides a
simple front-end which merely dumps the Lua table built from the log.

Support for newer logs is planned.
